- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex Chang
      - I am a Javascript FrontEnd Developer from South African;
      - It started as a curious interest, developed into a hobby and is now my passion and basically consumes 90% of my time;
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about nodeJS, mongoDB and graphQL. If only there was enough hours of the day to learn it all.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting projects that present a challenge and inspire creativity and offer the chance to co-create with others.

- 📫 You can reach me on email at : iamalexchangi@gmail.com

Loog forward to hearing from you
